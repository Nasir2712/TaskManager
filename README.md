# TaskManager


This project is a Task Manager web application which allows a user to add, edit and delete tasks and categories. 
Front-end - Bootstrap, Back-end - javaScript, jQuery, mongoLab.
This application uses mongoLab, a remote database. The Api key is used from the database to POST, PUT AND DELETE requests using Ajax to perform CRUD operations in mongoLab through jQuery.
This project was made to enhance my skills further in web development by trying out newer technologies such MongoLab Data API.
Each MongoLab account comes with a Data API (disabled by default) that can be used to access the databases, collections and documents belonging to that account. The API exposes most of the operations you would find in the MongoDB driver, but offers them as a RESTful interface over HTTPS.
